Learned
-

CE topic
- models of mathematics - intuitionism, formalism and platonism; was able to relate the learnings of this course with real-world scenarios and biology; Concept of NFA applied in real life scenario.
- Determinism, Non-determinism & Computability's relation became more clear. Learned more about the theories in the chapter and realized how the idea that computers will soon be able to do everything that a human can do is not something to be too sure about. We collaborated on the project, did research on theories, tried to brainstorm ideas for CE, relating to CLO5.
- How can (quantum) physics be related to computation and turing machine.
- Human consciousness
- I concepts regarding computation have strengthened enough for me to confidently talk about the subject, my project in general was related to my personal interest computation comparing to a human brain to further research in AI
-I learned a great deal about artificial intelligence and its applications. I learned how the world is progressing in this unique realm and just doing wonders. Artificial intelligence is capable of not only mimicking but creating original art. This was one of the most interesting that I learned doing the CE.
- I learned about Computability, Decidability,  mathematical problem of what is Truth
- I learned about decidability and complexity.
- I learned about determinism and indeterminism, young's double-slit experiment
- I learned about how AI even though its just a machine but can act similar to humans
- I learned about how time complexity of a computation can be reduced using quantum computing.
- I learned about mathematical proofs and the different ways they are derived. I learned about how methods for proofs advanced or changed over time
- we learned what it means for a mathematical truth to be absolute.
- how clos of this course can be applied in real life. 
- how the world is using Turing test to confirm whether a computer is smart or not."
- about languages and expression
- why NP problems cannot be solved
- similarities between a natural brain and a network brain
- existence of different philosophical models of mathematics like Platonism, intuitionism and formalism
- how algorithms work in designing a computational physical world as we see it
- the possibilities of overcoming computability limitations using quantum computing.
- Relationship of brain with Computation theory.

Collaboration
- Successfully collaborating on a project
- I learned a lot about team work
- leading the team and group working throughout.

- Getting deeper insight of Universal Turing machine which was relevant to the Church-Turing Thesis.'
- I learnt more on computation along with the theoretical concepts of Computation
- there is a fun way to learn everything
- creativity
- It dived deep into the models and philosophy of maths which was very interesting to learn because it allowed us to see maths, computer science and computational problems, and its foundations in an entirely new light"
- It allowed me to view computation and its essence from numerous different vantage points."
- Presentation of a problem in a creative manner
- a summary of all the CLOS we have studied
- how to do a presentation in a creative way to engage the audience.
- I learned how to relate real life scenarios to the concept of decidability and how many things in our life are undecidable no matter what.
- really enjoyed learning new things
- many of my confusions related to conventional physics were cleared.
- look at such theoretical concepts from a very different lens

Improvement
-

-let the team make their own group
-make it clearer as to what should one focus on, little content (with good animations, etc) or more content (making playlists)"
- All students must be given a chance to view everyone's presentation together. Maybe in Audi or somewhere where we all can fit in together.
- some topics were more complex than others
- if we could've gotten some explanations of those topics it would've been easier for us to follow along
- having a brief introduction from someone who is well-versed in those topics
- By asking teams to do more things apart from plays and presentations.
- providing a clear rubric in the beginning of the assignment.
- making the topics more connected to Computation.
- if CE topics would be selected from the course syllabus
- was based on creativity however, there should still be some restriction to it.
- Having a larger time slot
- would love to see the work of students being displayed to entire HU community in future.
- topic of CE should be from our own book

- Everything thing is good.
- I am satisfied with the structure of the CE module
- I believe it was perfect as is. It was an interesting and creative way to take on the course
- I have no complaints or suggestions with the way CE was handled
- I really enjoyed CE, having an avenue to express ourselves artistically is I think a nice way to break from the monotony of a CS course, so I don't really have any improvements to offer, just praise.
- everything was well planned
- I think it is one of the best approaches for students to learn. Well
- its perfect.
- was designed and structured in a very engaging and interactive manner. The open endedness of the project brought forth some pretty unique and creative ways of expressing science, theory and maths which was amazing to observe.
- this was one thing to look forward to when all other science courses become too heavy and dry
- I think the CE was fun and a great learning experience.
- Would love to see more learning outcomes tested like this!
- no need of improvement.
- We not only studied about our own chapter but also learnt a lot from other's presentation.
- It was a non-conventional, fun and productive way of learning.
- well designed and I really enjoyed it.
- It was fun.
- It was perfect as is
- It was pretty great as it was. I liked the flexibility it gave to students to use their imagination.
- It was quite a good experience
- I liked the structure and creative freedom given in this assignment."
- best part of the NOC course
- The requirements were very well designed and a very good approach for projects.
- The timeline was planned out very well
- demonstration schedule was very well planned
- This was a very fun and exciting type of assessment. It gave me an opportunity to create art as my course project and I don't know what could've been better than this. One of the best projects I've ever done. It was really fun.
- I enjoyed watching presentations together in the playground and getting to interact with the people who made them. Would definitely prefer this over an exam.

- scope too large, gets confusing. a better guideline should be provided such that it also doest limit our creative approach at the same time?

- traditional presentations should be excluded
- take topic preferences from students
- by giving us more interesting topics.
- difficult to relate things to computability
- Some groups put in a lot of effort while other groups did not. I'd suggest working on making the requirements bit more clear so the scope and effort required for the project is well-defined.

- very open ended, should have some constraint so the creative expression would have some direction
- start working on it sooner
- a few examples of how to portray our CE (specifically the mode) 
- Should be held in the middle of the semester rather than the end of it
- Smaller topics to focus on
- Maybe a session can be incorporated to connect the course content with the CE topics assigned from books so that the dependency and relationship is explicitly understood. Overall it was good, and a fun and innovative way to read the book!

Other
-
- our assigned topic was somewhat more abstract in nature thus, a great amount of brainstorming was required

- The computability of mind will forever be a fascinating topic to me.
- crystal clear of how important turing machines are"

Organization
- i liked how there were 3 meetings, it helped in completing the tasks beforehand rather than doing all the work during the last week
- I liked the checkpoint meetings as they were effective in helping us stay on track and work on the project progressively instead of the usual tendency of trying to complete everything at the eleventh hour.
- I also really enjoyed the creative freedom in this assignment (although it did leave us slightly confused when deciding the scope of the project).
- I liked the entire idea of Creative Expression because the entire course was too heavy on theory so this was a good aspect. 
- I really liked how my CE was planned in the Playground.
- It was managed perfectly
- Teamwork was well coordinated, professor took updates which allowed us to be on and maintain our track.
- checkpoint meeting is quite useful such that it keeps the individual and other team members in check with respect to the progress of the work as opposed to, everyone forgetting about it until the very last minute.
- The logistics of CE were amazing and instructors supported us throughout. I really liked the weekly meetings as they helped us to make our CE better and directional.
- Additionally, it was helpful that we started planning the CE early since we changed our idea a couple of times but still had plenty of time to execute it."

- bad partners, not deisred

- other presentations were great

- it was a little difficult to divide the work as in our project

- Provide basic information from the start as to how the CE would be conducted

- the book was a little difficult to understand. But we managed to figure it by consulting external resources too.

- made theoretical computer science interesting to study."

- Some group members are not participating teachers should divide work equally by yourself.

- I was quite pleased that I was allowed to execute my vision completely.

- I was quite pleased with the efforts of my team-mates itself. Very rarely, am I in a project group where everyone contributes equally."

- it was something that we did not do before.

- The idea of CE was very clever. It was not only the good way to showcase our learning from the course but also helped to unleash our creative minds and expand our creative skills.
- It was refreshing to see wonderful presentations in-person after so long. 
- Would love to see this idea incorporated in future courses as well.

- The topics chosen were personally very intriguing 

- This was a nice and fun addition to the course since NoC can get a little dry.

- Time management for the final presentation can be improved.
- We enjoyed doing our CE. Team members did equal amount of work and we enjoyed exploring our topic in detail.

- It was an amazing experience.
